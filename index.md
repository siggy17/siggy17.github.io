With over 10 years as a technical IC then a leader, I've found my sweet spot at the intersection of strategy and technology - identifying opportunities, rallying the right people, and building the systems that turn ideas into results. My approach to being a TPM is based around establishing trust, navigating ambiguity with confidence, and applying my ingenuity to solve complex challenges.

Outside of work, you'll find me training Strongwoman style, silversmithing, and tutoring math and science. 

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects
### 1. Automating Tutoring Form 
I created a Python script to automate Airtable forms after tutoring sessions. I complete forms in seconds with 100% accuracy, eliminating typos and saving time. Script features:
- Prompts for student and session info
- Counts sessions automatically
- Manages cancellations
- Opens completed forms for quick verification

### 2. [Customizable Workout Timer](https://leafy-lamington-80f499.netlify.app/) 
_This project is in progress. The link above shows my work, with the EMOM workflow being the most complete section._

I'm building a web-based customizable workout timer for my gym community. Many members expressed frustration with not having access to the clocks or having their timers accidently reset. The timer will work directly in the browser - no app downloads or account creation needed.

## ðŸ§ª What I'm currently working on
- Learning automation and scripting with AI and Python
- Practicing strategic thinking through case study analysis
- Lifting a 200lb sandbag
~~Creating a 3D juice box brooch from sterling silver~~ ðŸŽ‰ Finished it!
