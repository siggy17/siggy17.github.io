With over 10 years as a technical IC, I've found my sweet spot at the intersection of strategy and technology - identifying opportunities, rallying the right people, and building the systems that turn ideas into results. My approach centers around establishing trust, navigating ambiguity with confidence, and applying my ingenuity to solve complex challenges.

Outside of work, you'll find me training Strongwoman, silversmithing, and tutoring math and science. 

## ðŸŒŸ Featured Projects
### [AI-Powered Feature Request Management System (Retool, Linear, Claude API)](https://noor7711.retool.com/apps/06aef926-5228-11f0-867c-ab4ac76a93f6/Feature%20Management/page1)
I built an intelligent feature request management system that automates prioritization and ticket creation for product teams, leveraging AI to quickly learn Retool. The system analyzes customer feedback using AI and automatically creates properly formatted Linear tickets for high-impact requests. Key features:

- Smart Prioritization: Claude API analyzes request descriptions, customer data, and business metrics to generate priority scores and implementation recommendations
- Automated Workflows: One-click ticket creation in Linear with pre-filled descriptions, acceptance criteria, and priority levels
- Real-time Dashboard: Retool interface displaying feature requests with AI-generated insights, priority scores, and business impact analysis

**Impact**: Reduces feature request processing time from 15-20 minutes to under 1 minute per request while providing data-driven prioritization insights that improve product decision-making.
**Tech Stack**: Retool for UI, Linear GraphQL API for ticket management, Anthropic Claude API for intelligent analysis, JavaScript for workflow automation.

### Automating Tutoring Form 
I created a Python script to automate Airtable forms after tutoring sessions. I complete forms in seconds with 100% accuracy, eliminating typos and saving time. Script features:
- Prompts for student and session info
- Counts sessions automatically
- Manages cancellations
- Opens completed forms for quick verification

### [Customizable Workout Timer](https://leafy-lamington-80f499.netlify.app/) 
_This project is in progress. The link above shows my work, with the EMOM workflow being the most complete section._

I'm building a web-based customizable workout timer for my gym community. Many members expressed frustration with not having access to the clocks or having their timers accidently reset. The timer will work directly in the browser - no app downloads or account creation needed.
